ll# Contract Deployment - Manual Steps Required
**Date**: 2025-09-26 19:17  
**Issue**: Command line deployment needs wallet connection

## ðŸš¨ **Current Situation**
- Thirdweb SDK requires wallet signer for deployment
- Command line deployment needs private key or wallet connection
- **Recommendation**: Use Thirdweb Dashboard instead

## ðŸŽ¯ **Easiest Solution: Thirdweb Dashboard**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Go to Thirdweb Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
   - Connect your wallet (MetaMask recommended)

2. **Deploy Contract**
   - Click "Deploy new contract"
   - Select "NFT Collection" (ERC-721)
   - Choose "Polygon Mumbai" network

3. **Contract Configuration**:
   ```
   Name: BeatsChain Music NFTs
   Symbol: BEATS
   Description: Music NFTs with AI-generated licensing
   Primary Sale Recipient: [Your wallet address]
   Royalty Recipient: [Your wallet address]  
   Royalty Percentage: 2.5%
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Review settings
   - Click "Deploy Now"
   - Confirm transaction in wallet
   - Wait for deployment confirmation

5. **Get Contract Address**
   - Copy the deployed contract address
   - Should look like: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`

## ðŸ”§ **Update Extension**

Once you have the contract address:

1. **Update popup.js**:
   ```javascript
   contractAddress: 'YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
   ```

2. **Update environment**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

3. **Test real minting**!

## ðŸ’° **Requirements**
- **Mumbai MATIC**: Get from https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- **MetaMask**: Connected to Mumbai testnet
- **Amount needed**: ~0.01 MATIC for deployment

## ðŸŽµ **Result**
After deployment, your BeatsChain extension will mint **real NFTs** on the blockchain! ðŸš€
