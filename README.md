BeatsChain Chrome Extension ‚Äì Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025

üìñ About the Project

Inspiration
BeatsChain was born from the idea that artists should own, license, and monetize their beats transparently. With Web3 and AI colliding, I saw a chance to reimagine how beats can be minted into NFTs with built-in licensing‚Äîright inside the browser.

What I Learned

How Chrome‚Äôs new built-in AI APIs can make the user experience smarter and faster.

How to design progressive builds‚Äîstart small with a Chrome extension, then scale into a full platform.

The importance of licensing metadata for music NFTs.


How I Built It

A Chrome extension (Next.js + Tailwind) as the core user interface.

Integrated Thirdweb SDK for blockchain interactions and NFT minting.

Google Sign-In for frictionless onboarding (with a hidden wallet under the hood).

WalletConnect for crypto-native users.

Chrome AI APIs for generating and validating licensing text.


Challenges I Faced

Balancing simplicity (contest MVP) vs. long-term vision (full BeatsChain ecosystem).

Ensuring progressive builds without breaking changes or duplicate files.

Designing a licensing flow that feels natural to artists but is legally meaningful.

üöÄ What Problem This Solves

Musicians often struggle to protect and monetize their work. Traditional platforms lock artists into systems where ownership is unclear, licensing is confusing, and payments are delayed.

BeatsChain solves this by:

Minting beats as NFTs with AI-generated licensing baked in.

Giving artists proof of ownership, licensing terms, and marketplace exposure in a single workflow.

Lowering onboarding barriers by using Google login ‚Üí instant wallet creation.

üõ† Tech Stack

Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript

Frameworks: Next.js, Tailwind CSS

Extension Platform: Chrome Extensions API (MV3)

Blockchain Infrastructure: Thirdweb SDK (NFT minting, contracts)

Authentication: Google Identity, WalletConnect

AI: Chrome built-in AI APIs (text summarization, content generation)

Cloud & Dev Tools: GitHub Codespaces, Amazon Q (AI coding assistant)



---

üß© MVP Scope (Contest Submission)

1. Chrome Extension UI

Upload beat (file input).

Input or AI-generate licensing terms.

Mint NFT with attached license.

Show transaction hash + ‚ÄúView on BeatsChain‚Äù link.



2. Blockchain Integration

Thirdweb handles minting + metadata storage.



3. Authentication

Google Sign-In with under-the-hood wallet.

Optional WalletConnect.




üëâ This MVP demonstrates AI + Chrome + Blockchain synergy without requiring external infrastructure.

üìä Dashboards

To make the system transparent, user-friendly, and trackable, the following dashboards are included/planned:

üîπ Contest MVP Dashboards

1. Minting Dashboard (Extension Popup)

Upload status (progress bar for beat upload).

AI License preview + approval.

NFT mint status (pending ‚Üí confirmed).

Transaction hash + NFT link.



2. User Wallet Dashboard (Extension)

Connected wallet balance.

List of minted beats (title, hash, link to BeatsChain).

Option to export/import private key (optional for advanced users).





---

üîπ Full Roadmap Dashboards

1. Artist Dashboard (beatschain.app)

Profile overview (bio, social links).

List of minted beats with licensing info.

Revenue tracking (royalties earned, splits).

AI insights (licensing suggestions, trends).



2. Community/Marketplace Dashboard

Search + filter minted beats.

Licensing terms clearly visible.

Purchase/download options.

Trending artists + top licensed beats.



3. Admin Dashboard (Internal)

System health (API calls, blockchain confirmations).

User activity (mints, logins, transactions).

Error tracking + logs.

Clean-up tools for redundant/failed uploads.





---

üìà Roadmap

Phase 1 ‚Äì Contest MVP

Chrome Extension (upload ‚Üí AI license ‚Üí mint).

Thirdweb blockchain integration.

Google Sign-In + Wallet under the hood.

Minting + User Wallet Dashboards.


Phase 2 ‚Äì Artist & Community Layer

Public marketplace for minted beats.

Profiles for artists.

AI contract assistant for richer licensing templates.

Dashboards: Artist + Marketplace.


Phase 3 ‚Äì Full Ecosystem

Royalty splits and multi-contributor smart contracts.

Tiered access (previews vs. licensed downloads).

Embedded wallets for instant onboarding.

Mobile PWA for wider reach.

Collaboration hub for co-minting and remix culture.

Dashboards: Admin + Advanced Analytics.



---

üßë‚Äçüíª Mandatory Dev Rules

Be comprehensive and holistic in implementation.

Maintain progressive builds: verify existing files, extend or enhance‚Äînever duplicate.

Enforce code sanitization and security best practices.

Ensure no breaking changes between iterations.

Apply a cleanup strategy for redundant/legacy files.

Write robust, maintainable, and scalable code.

Ensure consistency across components (naming, file structure, styling).

Use version control properly: small, clear commits.

Always test with mock/fake data before production integration.

Document every new feature with inline comments + changelog updates.

Prioritize performance optimization (bundle size, async ops, caching).

Design for cross-platform resilience (extension + app).

Build with future-proofing in mind (modular, replaceable APIs).

Dashboards must always remain real-time, minimal, and user-friendly.

ü§ñ Amazon Q Prompt (for Dev Chat & Tracking)

You are my coding assistant for the BeatsChain Chrome Extension (Google Chrome AI Challenge 2025).  
Context:  
- The project mints beats into NFTs with built-in licensing via Chrome AI APIs.  
- Tech stack: Next.js, Tailwind, Thirdweb, Google Sign-In, WalletConnect.  
- MVP is a Chrome extension (not a full app).  
- Progressive build: extend files, no duplicates, maintain cleanliness.  
- Dashboards must be lightweight (Minting + Wallet for MVP), expandable later.  

Your role:  
- Help me design, code, and debug progressively.  
- Track tasks week by week until MVP submission.  
- Enforce mandatory Dev Rules (no breaking changes, clean builds, etc.).  
- Provide code samples, integration strategies, and test cases.  
- Keep context of past iterations when suggesting changes.  
- Guide dashboard integration to ensure real-time, clean UX.

‚úÖ Now your README has dashboards clearly scoped for MVP + roadmap, which makes it stronger for judges and easier for dev tracking.

Would you like me to also draw dashboard wireframes (Minting, Wallet, Artist) so you have visuals for the README or pitch deck?
