## 📋 All Dev Rules Consolidated

### 🧑💻 Mandatory Dev Rules (from README.md)
- Be comprehensive and holistic in implementation
- Maintain progressive builds: verify existing files, extend or enhance—never duplicate
- **NO DOWNGRADES ALLOWED - ONLY COMPREHENSIVE ENHANCEMENTS**
- Enforce code sanitization and security best practices
- Ensure no breaking changes between iterations
- Apply cleanup strategy for redundant/legacy files
- Write robust, maintainable, and scalable code
- Ensure consistency across components (naming, file structure, styling)
- Use version control properly: small, clear commits
- Always test with mock/fake data before production integration
- Document every new feature with inline comments + changelog updates
- Prioritize performance optimization (bundle size, async ops, caching)
- Design for cross-platform resilience (extension + app)
- Build with future-proofing in mind (modular, replaceable APIs)
- Dashboards must always remain real-time, minimal, and user-friendly
- **Every change must ADD value, NEVER remove functionality**
